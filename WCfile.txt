Luke Korsman Toggle navigation Home Experience Contact Me Luke Korsman About Me I hail from the land of 10,000 lakes and food on a stick. Computers have always been a part of my life. My elementary school was one of the few to have an actual computer lab. I still remember playing games like Oregon Trail and Odell Lake in school. From there, the age of the internet continued to fuel my interest. Throughout middle school and high school I would create websites for my friends using Geocities. I decided to explore other interests while in college. Which led me to study economics and statistics. After college, I hopped around some of the major Minnesotan companies until I decided I needed a change and moved to New York City. I landed a job working for a medical software company called Medidata Solutions. I spent 4.5 years working in Sales Operations pricing their products. Seeing how their software made a meaningful impact on society rekindled my interest in computers and furthered it into software development. I am a graduate student at Seattle University pursuing a master's in Computer Science. My other interests include playing and watching hockey, listening to music and playing the guitar, minimalism, sustainability, and learning about the universe.
